# Discrete Morse Theory

In this repository, you can find my bachelorâ€™s thesis in Mathematics, written at the University of Trento under the supervision of Professor Alessandro Oneto.

The thesis is an introduction to discrete Morse theory, presenting some potential applications to social sciences and homology computation.
